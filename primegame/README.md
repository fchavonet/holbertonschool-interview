## <span id="description">Description</span>

This project implements a strategic game between two players, Maria and Ben, involving prime numbers and optimal game theory. The game is played on a set of consecutive integers starting from `1` up to and including `n`. Players take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number along with all its multiples from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

The challenge is to determine the winner across multiple rounds of the game, where each round may have a different value of `n`, assuming both players play optimally and Maria always goes first.

## <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

At the end of this project, I should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

- How to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers.
- Game theory concepts and how to determine optimal strategies.
- How to analyze multiple game rounds and determine the overall winner.
- The relationship between prime numbers and game theory in competitive scenarios.
- How to optimize algorithms for performance within given constraints.

## <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>

- All my files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all my files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- My code should be documented.
- My code should use the `PEP` 8 style (version 1.7.x).
- All my files must be executable.

Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from `1` up to and including `n`, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

- Prototype: `def isWinner(x, nums)`.
- where x is the number of rounds and `nums` is an array of `n`.
- Return: name of the player that won the most rounds.
- If the winner cannot be determined, return `None`.
- You can assume `n` and `x` will not be larger than 10000.
- You cannot import any packages in this task.

Example:

- `x` = `3`, `nums` = `[4, 5, 1]`.

First round: `4`

- Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3.
- Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1.
- Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose.

Second round: `5`

- Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3, 5.
- Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1, 5.
- Maria picks 5 and removes 5, leaving 1.
- Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose.

Third round: `1`

- Ben wins because there are no prime numbers for Maria to choose

**Result: Ben has the most wins!**

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/primegame$ cat main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

isWinner = __import__('0-prime_game').isWinner


print("Winner: {}".format(isWinner(5, [2, 5, 1, 4, 3])))

carrie@ubuntu:~/primegame$
```

```bash
carrie@ubuntu:~/primegame$ ./main_0.py
Winner: Ben
carrie@ubuntu:~/primegame$
```

cd primegame
```

4. Ensure Python files are executable:

```bash
chmod +x 0-prime_game.py main_0.py
```
