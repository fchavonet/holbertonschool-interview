## <span id="description">Description</span>

This repository contains various algorithmic and technical interview preparation exercises developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

Each folder represents a standalone problem-solving project, focused on improving data structures, algorithmic thinking, and coding efficiency.

These exercises are meant to sharpen problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and reinforce key computer science fundamentals.
